I've been a Front-end developer for just over 10 years, I've worked with several technologies such as React, React Native, Next, Vue, Nuxt, Typescript, Jest among many others. I have skills in UX/UI and team management. I'm curious and like to test new technologies and solutions for web/mobile development.
